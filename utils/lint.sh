# CKV_AWS_18 - Ensure AWS access logging is enabled on S3 buckets - Public is not publically shared, and access is limited to QS and account Admins thus logging is not required. Also avoid additional costs. 
# CKV_AWS_116 - Ensure the S3 bucket has logging enabled - Public is not publically shared, and access is limited to QS and account Admins thus logging is not required. Also avoid additional costs. 
# CKV_AWS_117 - Ensure AWS Lambda function is configured inside a VPC - Not requied for Lambda functionality as only AWS API calls are used. 
# CKV_AWS_173 - Check encryption settings for Lambda environmental variable - No sensitive parameters in environmental variables
# CKV_AWS_195 - Ensure Glue component has a security configuration associated - AWS managed encryption is used for s3.
# CKV_SECRET_6 - Base64 High Entropy String - Remove false positives
# CKV_AWS_115 - Ensure that AWS Lambda function is configured for function-level concurrent execution limit - No need for concurency reservation
# CKV_AWS_158 - Ensure that CloudWatch Log Group is encrypted by KMS - No need as there no sesible information in the logs
